## 🚀 Overview  
**Interactive Map with OpenCV** is a computer vision–powered application that enables users to interact with a physical map through hand and finger gestures. By combining real-time image processing and spatial mapping, the system bridges physical geography with digital interaction—ideal for educational tools, museum displays, and low-cost interactive kiosks.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
- Real-time detection of user finger positions and gestures on a physical map.  
- Dynamic on-screen overlays displaying information about the selected region.  
- Interactive controls for zooming, highlighting, or retrieving metadata.  
- Modular architecture designed for quick adaptation to different map layouts.  
- Lightweight implementation optimized for use with standard webcams.  

## 💡 Motivation  
Interactive maps enhance how people explore spatial information, especially in environments with limited digital infrastructure.  
This project demonstrates how accessible AI tools—like OpenCV—can make learning and navigation more engaging and inclusive. It also reflects my broader research interests in human–AI interaction and computer vision systems deployable in the real world.  

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x** — Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** — Real-time image and gesture processing  
- **NumPy / Pandas** — Data handling and region mapping  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Visualization during experimentation  
- **Ultralytics YOLO (optional)** — Advanced hand or finger detection  
- **Albumentations** — Image augmentation for robustness  
- **Docker** — Containerized deployment for reproducibility
